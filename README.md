In order to do that open de folder "Ruby_basics" and a new terminal window:
* (ctrl + mayus + Ã±) in Windows
* Open terminal app on Mac 
Type irb. 

IRB is your playground -a ruby-based console that will allow you to test any ruby code you want to use. 

You can use the given examples in this repo to try the code on the irb and see how things work on Ruby.

Enjoy coding!
